# Epic 2: UI Foundation - Dashboard Layout & Navigation

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Epic Owner**: Product Owner  
**Start Date**: January 24, 2026  
**Target Completion**: Sprint 1 (2 weeks)

---

## Epic Overview

Establish the foundational user interface for TeamFlow using Angular Material, creating a professional dashboard-style application that feels modern and intuitive for team collaboration.

### Business Value

**Why This Matters**:
- First impression matters: Users judge product quality within seconds of opening the app
- Dashboard layout is familiar to target users (Sarah, Mike, Linda) from tools like Slack, Asana, Monday.com
- Side navigation enables scalable feature access as we add more modules (Calendar, Time Tracking)
- Angular Material provides consistent, professional UI patterns that reduce development time
- Clean, modern interface differentiates us from complex, overwhelming competitors

**Target Users Impacted**:
- **All Users** (Sarah, Mike, Linda): Need intuitive navigation to access features quickly
- **New Users**: Need clear welcome message to understand where to start
- **Team Members**: Need consistent UI patterns to learn the product faster

### Success Criteria

This epic is successful when:
- ✅ Application has professional, modern appearance (Angular Material theme applied)
- ✅ Users see clear welcome message explaining what TeamFlow does
- ✅ Users can toggle side navigation menu on/off for flexible workspace
- ✅ Dashboard layout feels familiar to users of modern collaboration tools
- ✅ UI foundation supports future feature additions without redesign

### Product Vision Alignment

**Simplicity**: Dashboard layout with collapsible menu keeps interface clean and uncluttered

**User-Focused**: Familiar navigation patterns reduce learning curve for non-technical teams

**Scalable**: Side menu structure allows adding Calendar and Time Tracking modules later without UI redesign

## Epic Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Professional UI Theme**: Implement Angular Material for consistent, modern design language
2. **Clear User Onboarding**: Replace generic placeholder with welcoming, informative home page
3. **Dashboard Navigation**: Create familiar side-menu layout for intuitive feature access
4. **Multi-Level Navigation**: Implement tree-menu structure supporting up to 3 levels with routing

### Secondary Goals (Future Sprints)
- User profile menu in header
- Workspace/organization selector
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Notification center

## User Stories

This epic consists of 4 user stories:

### Story 2.1: Angular Material Design System
> Establish consistent, professional UI patterns with Angular Material

**Why**: Users expect modern SaaS tools to look polished and professional. Angular Material provides battle-tested components that make TeamFlow feel trustworthy and high-quality.

**Priority**: MUST-HAVE (Foundation for all UI work)

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

---

### Story 2.2: Welcome Home Page
> Replace placeholder content with clear, welcoming message that explains TeamFlow's purpose

**Why**: First-time users need to understand what TeamFlow does and feel welcomed. Generic "Hello Frontend" message provides no value and looks unprofessional.

**Priority**: MUST-HAVE (First user impression)

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours

---

### Story 2.3: Dashboard Layout with Side Navigation
> Create dashboard-style interface with collapsible side menu for feature navigation

**Why**: Dashboard layout with side navigation is the expected pattern for project management tools. Users coming from Asana, Monday.com, Jira expect left-side menu. Collapsible menu gives users control over workspace real estate.

**Priority**: MUST-HAVE (Core navigation pattern)

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

---

### Story 2.4: Multi-Level Tree Navigation Menu
> Implement hierarchical menu structure with 3 levels and routing to SPA pages

**Why**: Users need to navigate through hierarchical feature organization (Workspaces → Projects → Tasks). Multi-level expandable menu supports complex information architecture while keeping interface clean. Essential for scaling to Calendar and Time Tracking modules.

**Priority**: MUST-HAVE (Enables feature scalability)

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours

---

## Dependencies

### Prerequisite Work
- ✅ Epic 1 Complete: Development environment set up
- ✅ Angular application initialized
- ✅ Basic routing configured

### Enables Future Work
- Epic 3: Authentication UI (login/register forms will use Material components)
- Epic 4: Workspace Management UI (menu will contain workspace navigation)
- Epic 5: Project Management UI (dashboard will host project views)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Learning Curve with Angular Material
**Impact**: Medium  
**Probability**: Low  
**Mitigation**: Angular Material has excellent documentation and examples. Start with basic components (button, card, sidenav) before advanced features.

### Risk 2: Overdesigning Too Early
**Impact**: Medium (Delays MVP)  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Mitigation**: Use default Material theme "as-is" for MVP. Custom theming comes later. Focus on functionality over pixel-perfect design.

### Risk 3: Mobile Responsiveness
**Impact**: Low (Responsive web is MVP requirement)  
**Probability**: Low  
**Mitigation**: Angular Material components are mobile-responsive by default. Test on mobile throughout development.

## Out of Scope (For This Epic)

❌ **Not Included**:
- Custom Material theme colors (use defaults)
- Header/toolbar with user profile
- Multiple navigation menu items (just Home for now)
- Dark mode / theme switching
- Workspace/organization selector
- Search functionality
- Notifications
- Mobile-specific layouts (responsive web sufficient)

**Rationale**: Focus on establishing the pattern and structure. Polish and additional features come in later epics based on user feedback.
