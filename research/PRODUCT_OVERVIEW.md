## What Problems Does TeamFlow Solve?

### Problem 1: Enterprise Tools Are Too Complex
**User Pain**: Small teams don't need 80% of features in tools like Jira. They want simple task management.
**TeamFlow Solution**: Base platform focused on core needs. No feature bloat.

### Problem 2: Pricing Is Confusing and Expensive
**User Pain**: Competitors force you to buy features you don't need. Per-user costs add up.
**TeamFlow Solution**: Transparent pricing. Start cheap, add modules as needed.

### Problem 3: Time Tracking Is Separate from Work Management
**User Pain**: Agencies use one tool for tasks (Asana) and another for time (Toggl/Harvest). Data lives in silos.
**TeamFlow Solution**: Time Tracking module integrates directly with tasks and projects.

### Problem 4: No Good Tools for Non-Technical Teams
**User Pain**: Marketing teams, agencies, consultants find developer tools (Jira) confusing.
**TeamFlow Solution**: Built for general business teams, not just engineers.

## Key Product Principles

These principles guide all product decisions:

### 1. Simplicity Over Features
- Every feature must justify its existence
- When in doubt, leave it out
- Simple workflows beat powerful but confusing ones

### 2. Fair, Transparent Pricing
- No hidden costs
- No forcing features users don't need
- Clear upgrade paths

### 3. Modular Growth
- Users start simple (Base platform)
- Add modules as their needs grow
- Don't overwhelm new users

### 4. User Outcomes Over Technology
- Focus on what users accomplish, not how we build it
- Business users don't care about tech stacks
- Make it work reliably and intuitively

### 5. Compete on Value, Not Features
- We won't have every feature Monday.com has - that's okay
- We win by being better for our specific audience
- Better = simpler, cheaper, more focused

## Common Questions

### Q: What's the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?
**A**: The Base Platform. Users must be able to create projects, add tasks, assign them, and track completion. Everything else is secondary.

### Q: Who are our biggest competitors?
**A**: Asana, Monday.com, ClickUp, and Trello (for small teams). We differentiate on simplicity and modular pricing.

### Q: What makes TeamFlow different?
**A**: Modular approach (pay for what you need), focus on non-technical teams, integrated time tracking for agencies.

### Q: What's our biggest risk?
**A**: Being "just another project management tool." We need clear positioning and must deliver on simplicity and value.

**A**: Not extensively (like Jira). We offer opinionated, simple workflows. Customization adds complexity we want to avoid.

### Q: What integrations are planned?
**A**: Google Calendar, Outlook (for Calendar Module). Later: Slack, Zapier, export APIs for time tracking data.

### Q: Is TeamFlow mobile-friendly?
**A**: Yes, responsive web design. Native mobile apps are post-MVP.
