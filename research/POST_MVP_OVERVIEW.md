# TeamFlow - Post-MVP Overview

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-22

This document outlines what happens after the MVP launches and the planned evolution of TeamFlow.

---

## The Post-MVP Journey

**MVP Launch = Beginning, Not End**

The MVP proves the concept. What comes next determines if TeamFlow becomes a sustainable business.

---

## Phase 1: Post-Launch (Weeks 1-4 after MVP)

**Goal**: Stabilize, learn, and iterate based on real usage

### Focus Areas

**1. Monitor & Stabilize**
- Watch for critical bugs and fix immediately
- Monitor server performance and uptime
- Track error rates and crash reports
- Ensure email delivery works (invitations)

**2. Gather Feedback**
- Talk to every early user who will talk to you
- Send feedback surveys
- Track feature requests
- Observe how users actually use the product (vs. how you expected)

**3. Measure Key Metrics**
- User signups per week
- Activation rate (% who create workspace + project + task)
- Weekly active users
- Retention (% who return after 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month)
- Task creation rate
- Comment activity (collaboration indicator)

**4. Quick Wins**
- Fix the most painful UX issues
- Add small features users consistently request
- Improve onboarding if users drop off early

### Activities

**Week 1-2**:
- Fix critical bugs reported by users
- Monitor analytics daily
- Reach out to first 10 users for feedback calls
- Document all feature requests

**Week 3-4**:
- Analyze feedback patterns (what do most users ask for?)
- Prioritize next features based on feedback + business goals
- Make quick UX improvements
- Plan Phase 2 development

### Success Indicators

✅ **MVP is working if**:
- Users complete the signup → create workspace → create project → create tasks flow
- Users return weekly (retention > 30%)
- Users invite team members (viral growth)
- Feedback is mostly positive ("This solves our problem!")
- Users ask about pricing/paying (willingness to pay signal)

⚠️ **Warning signs**:
- Users sign up but don't create workspaces (onboarding problem)
- Users create projects but not tasks (unclear value or UX issue)
- No one invites team members (not collaborative enough)
- Users don't return after first session (not sticky)
- Negative feedback about core features

---

## Phase 2: Base Platform Enhancements (Months 2-3)

**Goal**: Make the base platform more powerful and sticky

**Why enhance before adding modules?**
- Base platform must be solid before adding paid features
- Users need to love the free tier before they'll pay for modules
- Build strong foundation = easier to upsell later

### Planned Enhancements

**Priority 1: Must-Haves** (based on expected feedback)
- **File Attachments on Tasks**: Users need to share documents, images
- **Task Search & Filtering**: Essential as workspaces grow
- **@Mentions in Comments**: Improves collaboration
- **Notifications**: Email or in-app when mentioned, assigned, etc.
- **Activity Feed**: See what's happening in workspace

**Priority 2: Nice-to-Haves**
- **Task Templates**: Recurring task patterns (e.g., onboarding checklist)
- **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple tasks, bulk assign/update
- **Task Dependencies**: "Task B can't start until Task A is done"
- **Advanced Permissions**: More granular roles beyond Owner/Member
- **Custom Task Fields**: Add fields specific to team's workflow

**Priority 3: Polish**
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user efficiency
- **Dark Mode**: User preference
- **Better Mobile Experience**: Native-like mobile web
- **Performance Optimizations**: Faster load times
- **Improved Onboarding**: Guided tours, tooltips

### How to Prioritize

**Decision Framework**:
1. **What do users ask for most?** (frequency of requests)
2. **What drives retention?** (features that make users return)
3. **What enables viral growth?** (features that get users to invite others)
4. **What reduces churn?** (features that prevent users from leaving)

**Example**:
- If users consistently request file attachments → Priority 1
- If users complain about not finding tasks → Search becomes Priority 1
- If users mention a feature once → Backlog for later

### Timeline

- **Month 2**: Build 2-3 Priority 1 features
- **Month 3**: Build 2-3 more Priority 1 features + polish

**By end of Phase 2**: Base platform is feature-complete and loved by users.

## Key Decisions to Make Post-MVP

### Question 1: Who are your best customers?
- Which user segments love the product most?
- Agencies? Startups? Consultancies? Remote teams?
- Double down on serving them well

### Question 2: What's your moat?
- Why would users choose TeamFlow over Asana/Monday.com?
- Simplicity? Pricing? Time tracking integration?
- Lean into your differentiator

### Question 3: Build vs. Buy vs. Integrate?
- Should you build every feature or integrate with existing tools?
- Example: Build calendar OR integrate with Google Calendar?
- Decision impacts roadmap significantly

### Question 4: Growth strategy?
- Product-led growth (viral, word-of-mouth)?
- Sales-led growth (outbound, demos)?
- Marketing-led growth (content, ads)?
- Determines resource allocation

### Question 5: Team size?
- Stay solo/small team?
- Hire developers/designers?
- When to hire? (Based on revenue milestones)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Users don't upgrade to paid tiers
- **Mitigation**: Ensure free tier has limitations that drive upgrades
- **Mitigation**: Make paid features compelling (calendar, time tracking solve real pain)
- **Mitigation**: Trial period for paid tiers (30-day free trial)

### Risk: Competitors copy your features
- **Mitigation**: Move fast, keep innovating
- **Mitigation**: Build strong brand and community
- **Mitigation**: Focus on execution, not just features

### Risk: Can't scale infrastructure
- **Mitigation**: Use managed services (less ops burden)
- **Mitigation**: Plan for scale early (database indexes, caching)
- **Mitigation**: Monitor performance continuously

### Risk: Burn out (especially solo founders)
- **Mitigation**: Pace yourself, this is a marathon
- **Mitigation**: Automate repetitive tasks
- **Mitigation**: Hire help when revenue supports it

### Risk: Running out of money
- **Mitigation**: Keep costs low (use free tiers, minimal infra)
- **Mitigation**: Charge early (don't stay free forever)
- **Mitigation**: Consider bootstrapping vs. fundraising
